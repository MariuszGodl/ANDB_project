Database overview

This database is used for a scholarship application system. It stores information about students, their scholarship applications, the files they upload as supporting documents, and a basic audit log of important actions. The database is relational and runs on PostgreSQL.

There are four main tables:

    student

    application

    supportingdocument

    auditlog

Tables and fields
1. student table

Stores basic personal data for each student.

    studentid – integer, primary key, automatically generated.

    firstname – text (up to 100 chars), required; student’s first name.

    lastname – text (up to 100 chars), required; student’s last name.

    email – text (up to 255 chars), required, must be unique; used to identify a student.

    phoneno – text (up to 20 chars), optional; phone number.

    dateofbirth – date, required; must not be in the future.

    address – text (up to 255 chars), required; student’s address.

    createdat – timestamp; when the record was created.

2. application table

Represents one scholarship application submitted by a student.

    applicationid – integer, primary key, automatically generated.

    studentid – integer, required; foreign key pointing to student.studentid.

    status – text (up to 50 chars), required; default is 'Draft'. Allowed values: Draft, Submitted, Under Review, Accepted, Rejected.

    academicyear – integer, required; the academic year of the application (e.g. 2025).

    gpa – decimal(3,2), required; student’s GPA, must be between 0.00 and 5.00.

    essaytext – text, required; the personal statement / essay.

    applicationdate – timestamp; date and time when the application was created.

3. supportingdocument table

Holds information about uploaded files that belong to an application.

    documentid – integer, primary key, automatically generated.

    applicationid – integer, required; foreign key pointing to application.applicationid.

    filename – text (up to 255 chars), required; original name of the file.

    filepath – text (up to 512 chars), required; path to the file on the server (e.g. uploads/myfile.pdf).

    filetype – text (up to 50 chars), required; MIME type like application/pdf.

    filesizekb – integer, required; file size in kilobytes, must be > 0.

    uploaddate – timestamp; when the file was uploaded.

4. auditlog table

Stores simple log entries for important events in the system.

    logid – integer, primary key, automatically generated.

    timestamp – timestamp; when the event was logged.

    eventtype – text (up to 50 chars), required; type of event, e.g. Application Submitted.

    details – text, optional; extra info, for example IDs of related records.

Relationships

    One student can have many applications

        Relationship: student (1) — (N) application

        Implemented by foreign key application.studentid referencing student.studentid.

    One application can have many supporting documents

        Relationship: application (1) — (N) supportingdocument

        Implemented by foreign key supportingdocument.applicationid referencing application.applicationid.

    auditlog is independent

        It is not directly linked with foreign keys, but the details column usually stores IDs of students and applications for reference.

Indexes and constraints
Primary keys

    student.studentid

    application.applicationid

    supportingdocument.documentid

    auditlog.logid

Each of these uniquely identifies a row in its table.
Foreign keys

    application.studentid → student.studentid
    Every application must belong to an existing student.

    supportingdocument.applicationid → application.applicationid
    Every supporting document must belong to an existing application.

Unique and check constraints

    student.email is unique, so two students cannot have the same email.

    application.status is limited to specific values (Draft, Submitted, Under Review, Accepted, Rejected).

    application.gpa must be between 0.00 and 5.00.

    supportingdocument.filesizekb must be greater than 0.

    student.dateofbirth must not be in the future.

Additional indexes

To speed up common queries:

    Index on student(email) – fast lookup of a student by email.

    Index on application(status) – fast filtering by application status.

    Index on supportingdocument(applicationid) – fast access to documents for a given application.

    Index on auditlog(eventtype) – fast filtering of logs by event type.
